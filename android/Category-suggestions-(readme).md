# Category suggestions (readme)

Three new types of category suggestions were implemented as part of the Outreachy Dec '15 - Mar '16 project:

# 1. If a picture with geolocation is uploaded, nearby category suggestions are offered based on the categories of other Commons images with similar coordinates.

**Rationale:** Geographically-related categories are often relevant to an uploaded image, so suggesting them at the start makes categorization easier. 

**Choice of API:** This is documented at https://github.com/nicolas-raoul/apps-android-commons/wiki/Location-based-category-search . We query the Commons MediaWiki API for the Commons categories of pictures with geolocation within a radius of 10km of the uploaded pic's geolocation. This API automatically returns the n closest pictures. 

The categories found are also cached using the quadtree library, with a short-lived area->category dictionary established. If another pic is uploaded that has a geolocation that falls within a cached area, the cached categories are displayed and the API is not queried. This is done to reduce the load on the API, as people often upload several pics with similar locations.

**Sample request:**

# 2. If a picture with no geolocation is uploaded, nearby category suggestions are offered based on the user's current location. This is optional and only works if enabled in Settings.

**Rationale:** An extension of feature #1. Useful if someone doesn't want to geotag their pictures and uploads them while still in the same area. Disabled by default for privacy.

**Choice of API:** The same API as feature #1 is used, just queried using the user's geolocation instead of the picture's.

**Sample request:** 

Logs shown when submitting a pic with no coords and option is enabled:

    02-21 18:02:54.991: D/fr.free.nrw.commons.upload.GPSExtractor(3798): Picture has no GPS info
    02-21 18:02:54.991: D/fr.free.nrw.commons.upload.GPSExtractor(3798): Gps pref set to: true
    02-21 18:02:54.991: D/fr.free.nrw.commons.upload.GPSExtractor(3798): Current location values: Lat = -37.77988229 Long = 175.27933809

# 3. Category search (when typing in the search field) has been made more flexible

**Rationale:** Prior to this, category search was done solely by prefix search. E.g. if you searched for 'latte', you would only get categories that start with 'latte', which excludes many potentially relevant categories (i.e. 'iced latte'). Prefix search is useful when you are certain of what the exact name of the category you want is, but not so useful if you are unsure. So we wanted to retain prefix search, but also provide additional suggestions for relevant categories that do not share that prefix.

**Choice of API:** Documented at https://github.com/nicolas-raoul/apps-android-commons/wiki/Fuzzy-category-search . We settled on 'Method A', which queries the Commons MediaWiki API for pages of type "Category" (srnamespace=14), maximum 10 results (srlimit=10). These results are aggregated with the prefix search results and the duplicate suggestions are eliminated before they are displayed.

**Sample request:**
